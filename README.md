  <h4>In this project, I implemented a landing page that features a form capable of sending data to a Telegram bot. The landing page is designed to be responsive and adapt to different mobile devices. To develop this website, I utilized React for building the components and managing the application state. HTML was used to structure by the page content, and Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) was employed as a CSS preprocessor to enhance styling capabilities
    <br/>
Overall, this project showcases the combination of React, HTML, and Sass to create a responsive landing page with form submission functionality and a visually appealing design.

  In this project, I developed a small website featuring various animations. The website itself is not extensive, but it incorporates captivating animations to enhance the user experience. To achieve this, I utilized CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. The animations are carefully designed and implemented to bring visual appeal and interactivity to the website. Through the use of CSS animations, transitions, and JavaScript libraries, I was able to create engaging effects such as animated elements, smooth transitions, and interactive features.

  <h4>In this project, I developed a React-based website with routing functionality. The website includes multiple pages and navigation between them. Additionally, I implemented a form that collects user input and sends it to a Telegram bot for further processing. The frontend of the website is built using React, HTML, and JavaScript, while the styling is done using Sass. <br/>
  In addition to the above, I also implemented a responsive design for the mobile version of the website. This involved optimizing the layout, font sizes, and button sizes to ensure a seamless and user-friendly experience on mobile devices. The website adjusts dynamically based on the screen size, providing an optimized view for smaller screens. The mobile version retains the same functionality and features as the desktop version, allowing users to navigate the site, fill out forms, and interact with the Telegram bot seamlessly on their mobile devices.
